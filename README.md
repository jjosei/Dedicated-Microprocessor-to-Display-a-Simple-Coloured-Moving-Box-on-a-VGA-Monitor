# Dedicated-Microprocessor-to-Display-a-Simple-Coloured-Moving-Box-on-a-VGA-Monitor

**Design Methodology <br />**
-Xilinx ISE used for design using VHDL <br />
-The processor consists of a Datapath and Control Unit. <br />

**Synthesis and Implementation For FPGA  <br />**
-Design synthesised correctly for the retired Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA <br />
-The spartan 3 can be used as reference when deciding an FPGA for synthesis implementation of this project. <br />
